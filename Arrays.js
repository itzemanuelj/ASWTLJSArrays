// What is a variable that represents a list of values? Answer with one word.

Array

// An array comprises any number of ______. ("Values" would be correct, but I'm looking for another word.)

Element


// The number inside the square brackets is the element's ____.

Index

// In an array, the numbering starts with __.

0

// Create a new array, nums, comprising three numbers from 3 to 5.

var nums = [3,4,5];

// This array has been defined.

var names = ["Alf", "Bo", "Gail"];

// Specifying an array element, code an alert that displays "Gail".

alert(names[2]);

// Create an array with a single element, a string. The array hasn't been declared beforehand.

var elem = ["tom"];

// Create an array with three elements that are numbers. It hasn't been declared beforehand.

var numArray = [1, 2, 3];

// Assign to a variable the first element of an array. The variable hasn't been declared beforehand.

var elementArray = [cost];

// Create an array with three elements: a number, a string, and a variable. The array has been declared beforehand.

var elementsArray = [1, "hello", cost];

// Create an array with two string elements. Then assign the last element in the array to a variable. Neither the array nor the variable have been declared beforehand.

var arraystr = ["hello","world"];

var arrayReassign = arraystr[2];

// This array has been defined.
var names = ["Alf", "Bo", "Gail"];
// Specifying an array element, code an alert that displays "Gail".

alert(names[2]);

// Create an array with one string element. The array hasn't been declared beforehand.

 var oneArray = ["hello"];

// Create an array with three elements that are numbers. It hasn't been declared beforehand.

var threeArray = [1,2,3];

// Assign to a variable the first element of an array. The variable hasn't been declared beforehand.

var firstElement = name[0];

// Create an array with three elements: a number, a string, and a variable. The array has been declared beforehand.

var threeElems =  [1, "hello world", cost];

// Create an array with two string elements. Then assign the last element in the array to a variable. Neither the array nor the variable have been declared beforehand.

var twoStringArray = ["one", "two",];

var newArray = cost[2];

// Declare an array with three elements.
// Display the last element in an alert.
// Click the Run It button to run your code live.

var array3 = ["hello", "world", "!"];

// Declare an array with four elements.
// Display the first element in an alert.
// Click the Run It button to run your code live.
